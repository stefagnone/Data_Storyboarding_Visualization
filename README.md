# Data Storyboarding & Visualization Techniques

## Project Overview
This project focuses on applying advanced data visualization and storytelling techniques, encapsulating the core concepts learned in the course. Each activity in this assignment builds essential skills in presenting data-driven insights, enabling effective communication through structured slides, well-designed dashboards, and thoughtful narrative flow.

## Skills & Concepts Demonstrated
- **Data Storyboarding**: Built storyboards to guide visual storytelling for case studies.
- **Graph Selection & Design Principles**: Used graph selection, decluttering, and Gestalt principles for effective visuals.
- **Visualization Frameworks**: Applied the Minto Pyramid, TOPT Framework, and Audience Confusion Matrix to align visuals with audience needs.
- **Dashboarding**: Developed a comprehensive Tableau dashboard for technical support analysis.

## Deliverables
1. **Presentation Slides**: A 10-page PDF document showcasing the complete storyboard and visualizations.
2. **Tableau Packaged Workbook (Twbx)**: Interactive dashboard to support in-depth data exploration.

## Key Activities
1. **Technary Case Study** - Storyboarding for data insights.
2. **Graph Selection** - Choosing effective visuals for life expectancy and income data.
3. **Design Principles** - Enhancing clarity using Gestalt principles and preattentive attributes.
4. **Audience-Centric Storytelling** - Minto Pyramids and the WIIFT approach.
5. **Dashboarding with Tableau** - Building a dynamic technical support dashboard.
